AimAssist(AutoAim) System for Unreal FPS, TPS Game

It helps to play shooting games using mobile devices and game pads.   
I was inspired by the game 'It Takes Two' in implementing the system.

Automatically identify the target and manipulate the character's camera to the target's position.   
(Crosshairs do not move separately.)
